# Battleship Game

Welcome to my implementation of Battleship on GitHub! This version of Battleship offers three gameplay options: human vs human, human vs "mediocre" CPU, and human vs "good" CPU. I have designed and implemented AI opponents of varying difficulties using recursive and breadth-first search algorithms, making for a challenging and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features

- **Game Modes:** Choose from three different game modes: 
  - Human vs Human: Play against another person on the same computer.
  - Human vs "Mediocre" CPU: Challenge an AI opponent with basic strategy.
  - Human vs "Good" CPU: Take on a more challenging AI opponent with advanced strategy.

- **AI Opponents:** The AI opponents are powered by recursive and breadth-first search algorithms, offering varying levels of difficulty. The "Mediocre" CPU is a good starting point for beginners, while the "Good" CPU provides a more challenging experience.

- **Data Structures:** Key data structures, such as stacks, arrays, and linked lists, are used to manage game boards and store in-game data efficiently.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile and run the game using the appropriate commands for your programming language. For example:
   - If you're using Python: `python battleship.py`
   - If you're using Java: `java Battleship`

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select your game mode and start playing.

## Gameplay

The game follows the classic Battleship rules. Players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's hidden ships on a grid. The objective is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## AI Opponents

The AI opponents make use of different strategies and difficulty levels:

- **"Mediocre" CPU:** This AI opponent employs basic strategies to guess your ship locations. It's a great choice for practicing and learning the game.

- **"Good" CPU:** The advanced AI opponent uses recursive and breadth-first search algorithms to optimize its guesses and improve its chances of victory. It provides a challenging experience for experienced players.
