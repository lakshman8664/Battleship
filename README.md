# Battleship Game

Welcome to my implementation of Battleship on GitHub! This version of Battleship offers three gameplay options: human vs human, human vs "mediocre" CPU, and human vs "good" CPU. I have designed and implemented AI opponents of varying difficulties using recursive and breadth-first search algorithms, making for a challenging and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features

- **Game Modes:** Choose from three different game simulations: 
  - CPU vs CPU: A mini-game between two mediocre CPU players. Or, choose a 10-game match between a mediocre and an awful                 player, with no pauses. 
  - Human vs "Mediocre" CPU: Challenge an AI opponent with basic strategy.
  - Human vs "Good" CPU: Take on a more challenging AI opponent with advanced strategy.

- **AI Opponents:** The AI opponents are powered by recursive and breadth-first search algorithms, offering varying levels of difficulty. The "Mediocre" CPU is a good starting point for beginners, while the "Good" CPU provides a more challenging experience.

- **Data Structures:** Key data structures, such as stacks, arrays, and linked lists, are used to manage game boards and store in-game data efficiently.

## Gameplay

The game follows the classic Battleship rules. Players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's hidden ships on a grid. The objective is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## AI Opponents

The AI opponents make use of different strategies and difficulty levels:

- **"Mediocre" CPU:** This AI opponent employs basic strategies to guess your ship locations. It's a great choice for practicing and learning the game.

- **"Good" CPU:** The advanced AI opponent uses recursive and breadth-first search algorithms to optimize its guesses and improve its chances of victory. It provides a challenging experience for experienced players.
